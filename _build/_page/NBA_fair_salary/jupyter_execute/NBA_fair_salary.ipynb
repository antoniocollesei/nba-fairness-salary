    "# Fairness by Counterfactuals\n",
    "This notebook will demonstrate how to implement the concept of \"fairness\" in a case of multiclass classification. \n",
    "Usually, fairness and explainability focus on the descriptive side of the model, providing the variables that impact the most the final prediction/classification. \n",
    "We will be using a library named DiCE (https://github.com/interpretml/DiCE) which is able to provide active explanations through counterfactuals from the real data of a Machine Learning (ML) model. This way it would be possible to understand also how much a variable should change to reach the desired outcome\n",

    "## Case Study: NBA Players Salary Expectations\n",
    "We will be implementing DiCE with an official NBA database reporting players' stats and salary for 2022/2023 season. The aim is to suggest which (and, most importantly, how much) stats need to improve in order to expect a better salary. Let's jump right in."

    "A few key points can be drawn from this simple analysis, both for the player, and the league itself. Let's see: it appears that Naz Reid, in order to secure himself a 25M+ contract, should clearly improve his scoring efficiency. His mere 8.3 points and 3.0 field goals per night are not enough to be considered an elite player, so he should focus on buckets! And it makes completely sense.\n",
    "But other interesting take-aways are actually coming from noticeable trends at league level. Let's see some of them:\n",
    "* the NBA seems to care more on defensive rebounds (DRB) than offensive (ORB), since our Naz Reid should grab 3x more DRB, while on the ORB side he would just need to double his stats;\n",
    "* steals (STL) and blocks (BLK) are not highly rewarded since his defensive attitude could work just like it is (and his stats are pretty close to the league average, maybe the blocks are a bit closer to a medium-high level player);\n",
    "* the league rewards mature players, and it actually makes sense: young players coming into the league have a capped salary until they reach 5 years of militance in NBA; only after that they can be granted a max-extension, if their performance is elite."
